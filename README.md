Hi World !🌏
We were a team🔭 of 6 member from the Masai Web-17 batch. We worked on creating REST API and writing business logic for an E-commerce application. Our project performs fundamental operations of an e-commerce website, where our customer's data is validated, mapped, processed with business logic & persisted in the database.

 🚀 The Swagger link to check rest Api-> http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/
